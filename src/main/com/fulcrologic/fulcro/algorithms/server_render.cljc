  "This function normalizes the given state-tree using the root-component's query into standard client db format,
   it then walks the query and adds any missing data from union branches that are not the 'default' branch
   on the union itself. E.g. A union with initial state can only point to one thing, but you need the other branches
   in the normalized application database. Assumes all components (except possibly root-class) that need initial state
   use `:initial-state`.

   Useful for building a pre-populated db for server-side rendering.

   Returns a normalized client db with all union alternates initialized to their InitialAppState."
